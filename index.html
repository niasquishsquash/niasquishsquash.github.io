		<td>Wirt</td>
		<td>Wirt is the older half-brother of Gregory. He is the protagonist of the show, and views the world in a serious way, unlike his brother. He is determined and often makes a point of being a contrarian, which frequently leads the pair into trouble.</td>

		<td><img src="pics/greg.jpg" alt="A picture of Greg" width="300" height="260"></td>
		<td>Gregory</td>
		<td>Gregory, affectionately nicknamed Greg, is Wirt's younger half-brother. He is a very energetic boy who always has a smile on his face and very wild ideas on his mind. He has a habit of wandering out on his own. He has a pet frog, which he found before his descent into the Unknown. He also carries a rock (that was stolen from Mrs. Daniel's garden), that will randomly make Rock Facts. He is the deuteragonist of the show.</td>

		<td><img src="pics/woodsman.jpg" alt="A picture of the Woodsman" width="300" height="260"></td>
		<td>Woodsman</td>
		<td>The Woodsman is introduced in the Comics as an older man who depends greatly on his family for a sense of balance and security. Preferring a good book over the chance to explore the outdoors, the Woodsman is introverted and contently reserved. The Woodsman can potentially be seen as an ex-follower of the Beast. </td>

		<td>Gregory's pet frog is a character who appears in Over the Garden Wall. Throughout the story, the Frog appears to be a narrator of the brother's journey through the Dark Forest. He has many unnatural abilities that include the ability to talk (as well as sing) and play piano. </td>
